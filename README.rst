Packaging
---------

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Edit pyproject.toml as desired.
    # Create a wheel and source distribution in dist/:
    flit build
    # Create a wheel and source distribution in dist/ AND upload to PyPI:
    flit publish

One can build a single-file executable suitable for dropping into an Alpine-based container
with s6 (no Python or Plumbum necessary), using Docker and `pyinstaller-alpine`_.

.. _pyinstaller-alpine: https://github.com/inn0kenty/pyinstaller-alpine

From the inner `essex` folder:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" inn0kenty/pyinstaller-alpine:3.7 -F --clean ./essex.py

It comes out to ~10MB. Alternatively, a build script using the same image,
but Buildah rather than Docker, is included as `mkbin.sh`.
